Scripts to speed up your spatial audio workflow in Reaper

HOA_stems2encoder.lua

This script allows you to automatically route X number of stem tracks to an ambisonic encoder track, sequentially, using mono sends. 

1 - Create an encoder track (64ch for 7th order encoding), and put it to the right of your stem tracks in the mixer.

2 - Select your first stem track in the mixer, and holding shift, click on the encoder track (highlighting all stems and encoder)

3 - Run the script!
